# HSMA5: Geospatial Problems


**Welcome to the HSMA geospatial problems repo (5B)**.

## Module structure

> The module lecture slides are available in this repo, and the lecture is scheduled to take place on the afternoon of 24 January 2023.

## Learning outcomes

**By the end of the class you will have...**

* New tools to appraise geographic problems;
* Hands on experience of tackling small and medium sized location based problems in python; and
* Be able to create visualisations to represent different solutions to geographic location problems.

## Description of materials.

Following a short introductory presentation (`5B - Geospatial Problems.pdf`) we'll get straight into a guided code along before you'll work within your PSGs to complete an exercise.

### Code along notebooks

During the live session, we'll be working our way through a code along notebook; this can be found in the `code_along\` directory.

### Practical exercises notebook

The exercise notebook can be found in `exercise\` directory. In the exercise notebook you will work to solve a scenario focusing on the future of  Transient Ischaemic Attack (TIA) clinics in the South West. This will follow a similar structure to the code along exercise. This exercise will be completed within your Peer Support Groups.

### Solutions to exercise

> Solutions to the practical exercise will be released following the live lecture.
