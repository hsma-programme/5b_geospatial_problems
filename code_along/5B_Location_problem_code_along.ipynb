    "When you encounter a medium to large instance of a facility location problem (or any optimisation problem) it is often tempting to move quickly onto a sophisticated solution method.  But how do you know that it is better than a simple heuristic?  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Here you will use the random restarts algorithm (sometimes called random search) as a simple benchmark.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Random restarts is simple heuristic.  You allocate a computational budget - either in terms of iterations or execution time - and randomly generate solutions and evaluate them. For example, you might specify an execution time limit of 10 seconds and in that time evaluate as many random solutions as possible.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the cells below, we will demonstrate the following:\n",
    "* Using the `random_solution` function defined earlier create another function `random_restarts` that runs for fixed number of iterations i.e., 10.  This will mean that the algorithm will generate 10 random solutions and then evaluates them.  \n",
    "* The function returns a tuple of the best cost and best solution found when minimising the weighted average car travel time.\n",
    "* The use case will be 28 candidate locations and a budget of 8 clinics to place - that's over 3 millions possible combinations.\n",
    "* Try running the algorithm a few times or varying the budget (number of clinics). What do you notice?"
