    "\n",
    "Transient Ischaemic Attacks (TIAs) are a minor type of stroke (disruption of blood flow to the brain) where symptoms may last for up to 24 hours. TIAs can be important predictors of major strokes. These can can be fatal or cause substantial disability. Therefore, it is important for patients to have suitable and equitable access to a specialist TIA clinic shortly after their symptoms occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "This case study is set in Cornwall where TIA patients are currently assessed and treated at five clinic locations. Due to funding constraints not all locations are open every day. The locations are:\n",

    "* West Cornwall Hospital (WCH)\n",
